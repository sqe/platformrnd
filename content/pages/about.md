## Professional Highlights

### Agentic AI & MLOps Systems
Architected and delivered an MLOps-driven agentic quality engineering platform orchestrating distributed AI agents for web state capture, LLM-powered change detection, and RAG-enabled test generation. Engineered robust infrastructure integrating PostgreSQL, MinIO, Qdrant, Redis, and Kafka for scalable MLOps workflows, persistent artifact storage, semantic search, and real-time agent orchestration.

### Distributed Robotics & Edge Computing
Engineered production-grade infrastructure for containerized robotics applications on Kubernetes, featuring KubeEdge, ROS2, and multi-domain DDS networking. Designed eBPF-based datapaths with Cilium CNI enabling seamless ROS2 FastDDS interoperability for UDP multicast discovery. Built CLI tooling for dynamic edge node management, automated ROS2 deployment, and real-time resource monitoring.

### Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Engineering
- Architected and led migration of thousands of Kubernetes clusters (EKS to AKS) using Terraform, GitOps, and Velero
- Automated provisioning and decommissioning of thousands of self-hosted MySQL servers to Azure Database for MySQL via IaC
- Designed comprehensive Datadog and Grafana monitoring solutions with custom dashboards, SLO tracking, and real-time alerting
- Built DNS record management CLI utilities for Cloudflare and AWS Route53, automating customer onboarding/offboarding
- Implemented Just-In-Time Access to Azure MySQL infrastructure using Britive, reducing access overhead by 40%+

### Kubernetes & Container Orchestration
Expert in designing, scaling, and operating production Kubernetes clusters across AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), and GCP (GKE). Deep expertise in ArgoCD, Flux CD, Helm, Argo Workflows, multi-tenancy patterns, namespace isolation, and cost optimization. Proficient in Kubernetes operators (kopf-based), custom resource definitions, and RBAC security models.

### Infrastructure as Code & GitOps
Champion of Everything-as-Code culture—Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines. Designed and implemented GitOps workflows enabling reproducible, auditable cluster provisioning and lifecycle operations. Reduced MTTR (Median Time To Release) by 98.96% through GitOps automation.

### Observability & Monitoring
Built comprehensive observability platforms across Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack. Expertise in distributed tracing, SLO/SLA dashboards, synthetic transaction monitoring, real user monitoring (RUM), and proactive alerting. Established monitoring standards and runbooks elevating operational maturity.

### AI/GPU Infrastructure
- GPU acceleration, CUDA, MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) configurations
- LLM deployments (HuggingFace, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- RAG systems with vector databases (Qdrant, pgvector)
- Agentic system orchestration and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) workflows
- SageMaker, Conversational AI, Pre-trained model containerization
- ML/AI compute workload optimization (Vercel → AWS ECS Fargate)

### Security & Compliance
- DevSecOps practices with automated OWASP ZAP dynamic testing
- Lacework cloud security platform automation
- Keycloak SSO integration with MFA (AWS IAM, Azure AD, Okta via OIDC/SAML)
- Just-In-Time Access implementation and security policy enforcement
- ISO 27001 certification leadership and recertification
- AWS Partner badge (AWS Foundational Technical Review)

### Test Automation & Quality Engineering
As first QA hire at multiple organizations, established QA processes, test infrastructure, and automation frameworks. Led test automation across E-commerce, mobile, firmware, IoT, and ERP integrations. Created comprehensive CI/CD testing pipelines with Kubernetes test pods, Datadog instrumentation, and PagerDuty incident triggers.
